## License
This project is licensed under the **Open Software License 3.0**.

### About
OSL-3.0

This license is meant to be simple to understand, easily modifiable and applicable to a wide range of projects. Note that it is a copyleft license, unlike the nearly identical Academic Free License made by the same author.  Similar to the AGPL, the Open Software Licenses requires you to disclose your source code when you communicate software (which includes cloud/hosted distribution).
